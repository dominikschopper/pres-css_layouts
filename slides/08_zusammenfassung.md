## Summary & Next Steps

**What we learned:**
- **@layer:** Clean CSS architecture without specificity wars
- **:has():** Parent selectors finally possible
- **Container Queries:** True component responsiveness
- **Grid vs Flex:** Clear decision rules
- **CSS Nesting:** Fewer build tools needed

**Concrete recommendations for our team:**
1. Introduce CSS Reset
2. Evaluate @layer for new projects
3. Test :has() for form validation
4. Container Queries for component library
5. Grid for layouts, Flex for components
6. Try CSS Nesting for new components
